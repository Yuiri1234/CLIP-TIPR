# Sample Implementation for CLIP-TIPR (CLIP-driven Textbased Image Privacy Recognition)

This repository provides a **sample / reference implementation** associated with the following project:

```
@inproceedings{Irisawa2025,
    author    = {Yuta, Irisawa and Tomoaki, Yamazaki and Seiya, Ito and Shuhei, Kurita and Ryota, Akasaka and Masaki, Onishi and Kouzou, Ohara and Ken, Sakurada},
    title     = {Low-Latency Privacy-Aware Robot Behavior Guided by Automatically Generated Text Datasets},
    journal   = {IROS},
    year      = {2025}
  }
```

Due to missing configuration files, parts of the codebase (e.g., `clip_knn.py`) are not directly executable.
We nevertheless release the implementation to the extent possible for reference and research purposes.
