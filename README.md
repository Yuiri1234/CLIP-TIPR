# Low-Latency Privacy-Aware Robot Behavior Guided by Automatically Generated Text Datasets 
This repository is a project page of Low-Latency Privacy-Aware Robot Behavior Guided by Automatically Generated Text Datasets, and provides sample code for CLIP-driven Text-based Image Privacy Recognition (CLIP-TIPR) and example prompts for constructing the LPT dataset, as introduced in our paper.

CLIP-TIPR is a framework that leverages vision–language representations to enable low-latency, privacy-aware robot behavior without requiring large-scale image-level privacy annotations.
For details of the method and experimental results, please refer to the project page and the paper.

## Contents

- Paper (IEEE copyright) and videos
- Sample implementation of CLIP-TIPR
- Prompts used to construct the LPT (Language-based Privacy Text) dataset

This repository is intended to support understanding and reproduction of the core ideas rather than providing a fully optimized or production-ready implementation.
