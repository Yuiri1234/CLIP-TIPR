## Detailed Configuration for Dataset Construction

We constructed two types of text datasets using the GPT-4o API provided by OpenAI: the LLM Privacy Text Dataset (LPT Dataset), which contains scores from 0 to 10 for multiple privacy criteria, and a single-criterion format dataset based on a single privacy metric.

Since privacy values evolve over time, the privacy criteria for the LPT Dataset were not manually defined; instead, they were generated by the LLM itself to reflect the inherent perspectives of the model being used.

First, as shown in the prompt, the criteria for identifying privacy are listed through multiple iterations.

```
# Instruction
Imagine a moment in a private, embarrassing situation that you don't want anyone to see or photograph. 
Please classify the large criterias for judging private in such situations and explain simply these criterias.

# Output Format
{
    1: {
        "criteria": "~~~",
        "explanation": "~~~",
    },
    2: {
        ...
    },
    ...
    5: {
        ...
    }
}
```

In this process, both the number of criteria and the number of iterations for listing them were set to five. Next, using the following prompt, these criteria are grouped together through clustering.

```
# Instruction
Imagine a moment in a private, embarrassing situation that you don't want anyone to see or photograph. 
Create 5 clusters by grouping overlaps against the following criteria.

% All criteria and descriptions are listed here.

# Output Format
{
    1: {
        "criteria": ["~~~", "~~~"],
        "explanation": "~~~",
    },
    2: {
        ...
    },
    ...
    5: {
        ...
    }
}
```

Finally, by using the 3rd prompt, the groups are aggregated to obtain specific titles, such as "confidentiality" or "social norms," along with their respective definitions.

```
# Instruction
Imagine a moment in a private, embarrassing situation that you don't want anyone to see or photograph. 
Please re-name and describe each of the following groups.

% All groups and descriptions are listed here.

# Output Format
{
    1: {
        "criteria": "~~~",
        "explanation": "~~~",
    },
    2: {
        ...
    },
    ...
    5: {
        ...
    }
}
```

## LPT Dataset Construction
Next, based on the obtained criteria, we use multi-stage prompts designed to generate sentences different from those produced in the previous steps. This allows us to obtain text descriptions and scores for each criterion across both Private and Public scenes.

However, when generating "Public" content, simply providing the keyword "Public" tends to produce only scenes of people outdoors or behavior in public spaces. Therefore, to ensure a diverse range of public content, we prepared separate prompts for two categories: Indoor and Outdoor spaces. The following prompt shows the template used to generate private text and the scores for each privacy criterion in the LPT Dataset.

```
# Instructions
[Imagine a moment in a private, embarrassing situation that you don't want anyone to see or photograph.(1)]
Please list 25 concrete examples of [privacy concerns moments(2)] that mentions specific condition of the subjects (posture, action, etc..) in the form of captions.
Please score in the form of 0~10 (0 is no problem, 10 is a problem), according to the following criteria.

% All generated criteria and their descriptions are listed here.

Finally, please evaluate the overall score, which is the total of these scores, in the form of 0~10.

# Output Format
{
    1: {
        "text": "~~~",
        "score": {
            "~~~": 0~10,
            "~~~": 0~10,
            ...
            ”overall_score": 0~10,
        }
    },
    2: {
        ...
    },
    ...
    25: {
        ...
    }
}
```
